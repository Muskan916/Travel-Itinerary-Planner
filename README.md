###Developing a travel Itinerary Planner : Create a web application that allows users to plan their travel
itineraries dynamically. The app should provide suggestions based on user
preferences, budget, and real-time data such as weather conditions and local
events. Include features like automatic itinerary adjustments, travel expense
tracking, and a social sharing option for collaborative trip planning.
